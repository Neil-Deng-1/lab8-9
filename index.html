            <p> Data set from: <a href="https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/raw-data">Google's COVID-19 Open Data Respository</a></p>

                This visualization illustrates the number of COVID-19 cases in the US from 2020 to 2023. The color scheme of light yellow
                to dark red represents the number of cases, with light yellow indicating fewer cases and dark red indicating a higher number 
                of cases. I chose this color scheme because it is easy to interpret with light yellow to red clearly indicating the increasing
                number of cases. One clear trend are spikes in cases during the winter months. Another clear smaller pattern is a inital 
                spike in cases before leveling out.
